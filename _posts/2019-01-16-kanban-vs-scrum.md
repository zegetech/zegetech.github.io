<!-- intro -->
Software development is the process of conceiving, specifying, designing, programming, documenting, testing, and bug fixing involved in creating and maintaining applications, frameworks, or other software components.
Different development teams/individuals approach the software development process differently. The most common methodologies are 
1. Waterfall(A linear, more traditional approach to the software development process).
2. Agile(A more flexible, newer approach to the software development process).
Agile software development is an approach underwhich requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative efforts of team.

In this post, as indicated in the title, we will focus on the different frameworks that can be applied in Agile development methodology to manage workflow.
Scrum and Kanban.


<!-- body -->
## Scrum.
A design in which teams break their work into actions that can be completed within timeboxed iterations called **sprints**, no longer than a month. The team works as a unit to reach a common goal.


<!-- Scrum is based on the idea that customers will change their mind about what they want or need at any point in the software development cycle and that the problem cannot be fully understood or defined upfront. It instead focuses on how to maximize the teams ability to deliver the minimum viable requirements qutechnologiesickly, to timely respond to emerging requirements and changes, and to adapt to evolving . -->

## Kanban.

Kanban is an Agile framework that focuses for workflow management. It focuses on balancing tasks demands with available capacity. Kanban revolves around the idea that problems should be tackled by starting with what one understands and moving on from there.
Kanban is based but not limited to the following principles .

1. **visualization**  
    An informative board, usually referred to as a kanban board created to give an informative description of the available tasks and show their relationship to each other.
    Here's an example of a kanban board.

    The tasks progress through the board from backlog  section to the done section. A task is considered done only when it has been tested.

2. **Limited amout of Work-In-Progress(WIP)**    
   The idea here is to only commit to a new task once an existing task is completed and well in the done section. 

3. **Flow**  
   At the core of Kanban is the concept of “Flow”. This means that the tasks should flow through the system as evenly as possible, without long waiting times or blockages. Everything that hinders the flow should be critically examined.

   ## Advantages.

   1. Timeboxed iterations are optional.
   2. It is event driven.
   3. New items can be added whenever capacity is available.

   ## Disadvantage.

   1. Since timeboxed iterations are optional, if not implemented, tasks can drag on for too long.

<!-- intro -->
Software development is the process of conceiving, specifying, designing, programming, documenting, testing, and bug fixing involved in creating and maintaining applications, frameworks, or other software components.
Different development teams/individuals approach the software development process differently. The most common methodologies are 
1. Waterfall(A linear, more traditional approach to the software development process).
2. Agile(A more flexible, newer approach to the software development process).
Agile software development is an approach underwhich requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative efforts of team.

In this post, as indicated in the title, we will focus on the different frameworks that can be applied in Agile development methodology to manage workflow.
Scrum and Kanban.


<!-- body -->
## Scrum.
A design in which teams break their work into actions that can be completed within timeboxed iterations called **sprints**, no longer than a month. The team works as a unit to reach a common goal.
Scrum is based on the idea that customers will change their mind about what they want or need at any point of the software development process. The Scrum team are aware that the problem cannot be fully understood or defined upfront and instead focuses on how to maximize the teams ability to deliver the minimum viable requirements quickly, to timely respond to emerging requirements and changes, and to adapt to evolving technologies.

## Kanban.

Kanban is an Agile framework that focuses on the system. The team manages work by balancing demands with available capacity. Kanban revolves around the idea that problems should be tackled by starting with what one understands and moving on from there.

Product discovery:
- what is it?
  - a process that helps make sure we are creating useful products - utility
  - method of understanding customers to build products that solve problems
  - activities to determine if and why a product should be developed
  - validate that a market exists - customer will pay for it
  - validate problem then validate solution
  - should also apply to existing products
  - KPIs - how to measure success
  - [clearbridge](https://clearbridgemobile.com/the-step-by-step-guide-to-product-discovery/)
  - process will vary between organisations
    - understand and define your problem - it's all about problem validation
    - for each problem come up with possible solutions
    - pick the 'best' solutions and prototype
    - test how well the prototype works
  - gather info from actual/potential customers
- why is it important?
  - discover and build what is vital to customers
  - prove/disprove assumptions
  - don't waste resources
  - avoid product failure
  - mitigate risk of building a product nobody needs
  - address why people will use, who, uniqueness and what you gain from it
  - team will figure out if/not they can build product
  - team alignment - shared vision for project
  - align with business goals

Design sprint:
[Design Sprint](http://www.gv.com/sprint/)
- what is it?
  - timeboxed format for product discovery - developed and popularised by GV
  > The sprint is a five-day process for answering critical business questions through design, prototyping, and testing ideas with customers.
  - combines aspects from business strategy, innovation, behaviour science, design thinking
  - learn without building and launching an actual product or mvp

  - in the context of design thinking?
  - [the story](https://www.thesprintbook.com/videos/)

- why use a discovery sprint?
  - clear data from a realistic prototype - see user reactions
  - compress months of debate into a single week - focus
  - cross-functional team - discover competencies and build trust
  - take big risks
context: for product owners and project managers

- Process
  - single dedicated week with the team that will be responsible for the project
  - one team in one room
  - monday - problem map
  - tuesday - sketch ideas individually instead of group brainstorm
  - wednesday - pick solution to go with - decision maker picks solution
  - thursday - prototype idea - fake it
  - friday - test - one on one with customers

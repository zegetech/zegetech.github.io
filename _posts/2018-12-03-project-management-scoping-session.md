title: Product Development - Scoping Session
author: Tom Nyongesa

intro: Any sane person has thoughts each and every day. We have some that conceptualise and are actualized at some point in our lives but others just fly through our minds like a flash and are gone without real implementation. For others, we really got into the execution ship but later on everything came to a stand still and eventually stalled. What could have led to this? Could we have missed something? A great project begins with great planning! Let's walk through an experience I recently had in project/product planning.

I had just been admitted into an internship program with just a couple of days into it. A project lead shows up and tells us, team of interns, that there's this project in his mind that needs to be worked on from ground up and we need to have a meeting about it. From my experience in projects management before, I knew that we were up for some boring long meetings as usual.

We showed up to a clean whiteboard and a markpen in the Project lead's hands. We got comfortable in our seats, the project lead took the stage and there and then the meeting started. A few minutes into it, I was loving the meeting. It was so much involving, lots of questions on whether I had understood the idea, lots of jottings in our notebooks, lots of engagements, lots of laughter lots of water gulps. It was fun! It wasn't boring as usual. 

It was 2 hours of the interesting meeting. Looking down in my notebook, I had filled like 2 pages of my notebook and the whiteboard wa full of unarranged titles and points. We had just gone through a scoping session!

A scoping session is an engagement between a client and a team of experts. It's when the client introduces an idea in his mind to the experts, walks them through the idea, explain the end goal and what value he intends to bring to humanity, it's all about serving humanity. It helps the experts to be on the same page with the client. 

So after the interesting meeting, we were off to writing a concept note about our client's idea. The whiteboard remained unrubbed, no one would want to rub anything, it would be our point of reference in case we missed one or two things from the meeting. The following 3 days were occupied with lots of research around our client's area of interest and application - blog reads, article reads, youtube sessions, similar existing implementations...literally we touched on anything relevant. 

A concept note is a literal capture of a client's idea, the problem that needs to be solved, description of the solution and outstanding features that are impeccable when compared to existing solutions. It's a document that lays out the description of the idea/product in a less tech-savvy way. However, it involves a little bit of deep analysis of the whole idea.

The standard way of writing the concept note is as follows:
### Introduction
 	- This is the section where your reader is introduced to what is to follow ahead
### Background
 	- Here, some history on the trends of the relevant market, has has been done before and how things are being done currently.
### Problem Statement
 	- The challenges and the pains of the existing ecosystem.
### Solution
 	- The proposed solution to address the above stated pains and challenges
### Risks
 	- These are the unexpected things/events that may happen during the product development and could affect the product.
### Mitigation
 	- These are the proposed solutions on how to control the unexpected events. The how of addressing the risks if they come to pass.
### Conclusion
 	- Yea, you guessed it right!



If I am to present the concept note to my mum, who is obviously not tech-savvy, she would get a gist of what the idea is all about. We were to compile whatever points we had jotted in a comprehensible way. 

Discovery sprint follows afterwards!

This is normally a week-long intensive exercise that requires the product development team to put their heads down to work and get working prototypes of the prioritised solution among several solutions in the proposal! 

A sip of hot coffee will do me well at this time. Next week, I will write more on Development Sprint! In the meantime, share this out to your circle of friends. I will be so much grateful, thank you!

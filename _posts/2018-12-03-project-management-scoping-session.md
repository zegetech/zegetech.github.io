intro: We always have ideas each and every day. We reach out to our friends, colleagues, contractors and even family to help with implementation. Most oftenly the ideas appear so clear in our minds and when communicate them to others, we always make assumptions of their understanding of our ideas. Do you ask yourself whether they are thinking the way you are thinking? Are they seeing the world through your eyes? Scoping helps in this! It helps translate the clients idea to the project team to bring clarity and avoid friction.

It is analogical to viewing the something through glasses or rather a microscope for biologists. It's meant to make things clear, bring the understanding to people, help others see what the client sees and connect with the project.

Scoping is a stage in Zegetech's perfected and proven way of developing products. We call it [Agile Product Development](2019-01-16-agile-poduct-development.md). It entails the following main five stages:

1. Scoping: This is when the client introduces the idea to the project team for brainstorming and problem definition with the intention of getting everyone on the same page on what the project idea is all about. Expected output is a concept note, project estimates and a product discovery sprint plan. 

2. Discovery/Review: The project team then takes up the Scoping Session output, concept note, and go on a 5-day [product discovery sprint](2019-01-15-product-discovery.md). The result of the discovery sprint is the project storyboard, Software Requirement Specification(SRS), project plan, project resourcing and project estimates.

3. Design: This is the stage that entails prototyping, designing of the project solution, modelling, pitching, preparation and setup of project tools without a single line of code.

4. Development: With the product prototypes, models and mockups from the Design stage, the actual coding starts.Tests are then done to the already developed modules via a staging environment where the client can also attest to the ongoing work.

5. Pilot: The project team can now perform a live test of the developed product, fix found bugs and make continuous version releases to the market while at the same time doing a product-market fit analysis for future improvements.


To the why and how of the Scoping Session...

# Scoping

This is generally a 2-hour brainstorming session whereby the client introduces the idea to the project team leading to a further 'investigation' of the problems they are trying to solve, the opportunity and the reasons for developing the product. 

After signing an NDA, the client uses Zegetech's proprietary tool called *The Rise Guide* that helps the client think through their idea, the **WHYs**,**HOWs** and **WHATs** of their idea. It helps broaden the thinking, to get deeper into the core of the idea and its market suitability. The client's feedback on the rise guide will be used during the brainstorming session to make sure the right questions are asked. This ensures effectiveness. 

Literally, scoping is all about note taking and scribbling, contextual online researches, individual ideation and one on one interviews with the goal of getting everyone on the same page about the project idea. The team discusses the project specific goals, deliverables, estimates, product specific features and its resourceful estimates in terms of human, financial and time resources. 

The success of the scoping session is determined by how well the ideation, discussions, brainstorming is done and the selection of the project/products' stakeholders. The stakeholders or rather the project team members should be charmingly connected to the product otherwise the subsequent steps could hit a dead end.

## Conceptualization
Conceptualization follows immediately.

This is the documentation of the scoping session findings into a literal document called a **concept note**. It is the capture of a client's idea, the problem that needs to be solved, description of the solution, outstanding features of the product and its risks and mitigation. It's a document that lays out the description of the idea/product in a less tech-savvy way, a way that's way easier for even your mama to understand. If a new partner got on board, they would immediately have a grasp of what's going on faster.

> If you can't explain it in simple terms you don't understand it well enough.
~ Albert Einstein.

Our standard way of writing the concept note is as follows:
1. Introduction<br>
 	- This is the section where your reader is introduced to what is to follow ahead
2. Background<br>
 	- Here, some history on the trends of the relevant market, what has been done before and how things are being done currently.
3. Problem Statement<br>
 	- The challenges and the pains of the existing ecosystem.
4. Solution<br>
 	- The proposed solution to address the above stated pains and challenges
5. Risks<br>
 	- These are the unexpected things/events that may happen during the product development and could affect the product.
6. Mitigation<br>
 	- These are the proposed solutions on how to control the unexpected events. The how of addressing the risks if they come to pass.
7. Conclusion<br>
 	- Yea, you guessed it right!

### To repeat or not to repeat

Now after drawing up a concept note, it may come to light that you had it all wrong while scoping. This mostly happens when the client rejects the Concept Note. This calls for another Scoping Session where the project is put into perspective, again, going deeper and having more accurate explanations with crystal clear objectives. It is expected that this second round of scoping should lead to a more accurate Concept Note.

In a nutshell, the scoping session helps the client and the project team to answer these questions:

1. Who are the target users?
2. What problems are the target users experiencing? Past, current and 'future' problems if you can predict.
3. Is there any available solution. Is it helping out with the problems?
4. What are some of the risks that could affect the project/product?
5. What are the mitigation processes?

Answering the above questions clearly and accurately, sets a great and strong foundation for the product.

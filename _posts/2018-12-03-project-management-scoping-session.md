intro: We always have ideas each and every day. Some are conceptualised and are actualized at some point in our lives but others just fly through our minds like a flash and are gone without real implementation. What brings the difference? Is there a methodology of doing things the right way? Like learning how to hold your cup right, by the handle? Doing product development and management the right way?

Software products have a life cycle. The life cycle has several stages that when followed accurately would result in a product that would be deployed successfully in a real world that's full of unpredicted challenges and factors. The standard life cycle of product development entails the following main five stages with what's expected in each and every stage in bried:

### I. Scoping
 - This is when the client introduces the idea to the project team for brainstorming and problem definition with the intention of getting everyone on the same page on what the project idea is all about. Expected output is a concept note and sprint plan.

### II. Discovery/Review
 - The project team then takes up the Scoping Session output and go on a 5-day product discovery sprint. The result of the discovery sprint is the project storyboard, Software Requirement Specification(SRS), project plan, project resourcing and project estimates.

### III. Design
 - Prototyping, designing of project solution, modelling, pitching, project tools preparation and setup is done at this stage.

### IV. Development
 - The development environment can now be setup. The actual coding is then done, tests to different project modules done, test prototypes developed and documentation written.

### V. Pilot
 - The project team can now perform a live test of the developed product, fix found bugs and make continuous version releases to market while at the same time doing a product-market fit analysis fo future improvements.

Here's a recap of how we experienced our product development/management. We hope that this helps you put things into perspective on how things are done right. It is a serial account of every stage.

# Scoping Session

This was a session that involved a description of what the project was all about. It was an introduction to the idea. It involved an engagement between our client and us, the experts, with the sole reason of 'investigating' the client's idea. Literally, the whole meeting was all about note taking and scribbling, contextual online researches, individual ideation, questions and answers. After the 2-hour brainstorming session, we realized that we had really expounded on the project idea and gathered so much. At some point we thought that we had focused on quantity and not quality! But sometimes, we need quantity and not quality. 

## Conceptualization
It turned out that there is more to understanding the product than the brainstorming session. Conceptualization was to follow immediately.

A concept note is a literal capture of a client's idea, the problem that needs to be solved, description of the solution and outstanding features that are impeccable when compared to existing solutions. It's a document that lays out the description of the idea/product in a less tech-savvy way. 

> If you can't explain it in simple terms you don't understand it well enough.
~ Albert Einstein.

The standard way of writing the concept note is as follows:
#### Introduction
 	- This is the section where your reader is introduced to what is to follow ahead
#### Background
 	- Here, some history on the trends of the relevant market, what has been done before and how things are being done currently.
#### Problem Statement
 	- The challenges and the pains of the existing ecosystem.
#### Solution
 	- The proposed solution to address the above stated pains and challenges
#### Risks
 	- These are the unexpected things/events that may happen during the product development and could affect the product.
#### Mitigation
 	- These are the proposed solutions on how to control the unexpected events. The how of addressing the risks if they come to pass.
#### Conclusion
 	- Yea, you guessed it right!

### Re-scoping

Now after drawing up a concept note, it came to light that we had it all wrong.

We had another scoping session where the project was put into perspective, again. This second scoping session involved deeper and more accurate explanations with crystal clear objectives. The second round was the real charm that led to a more accurate Concept Note. This was now when quality was more important than quantity!

Nevertheless, the scoping session was more fun than we had thought.

In conclusion, the scoping session seeks to answer the following questions:

1. Who are the target users?
2. What problems are the target users experiencing? Past, current and 'future' problems if you can predict.
3. Is there any available solution. Is it helping out with the problems?
4. What are some of the risks that could affect the project/product?
5. What are the mitigation processes?

Our account of the product discovery sprint will follow soon.

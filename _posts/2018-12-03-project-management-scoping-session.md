intro: We always have ideas each and every day. Some are conceptualised and are actualized at some point in our lives but others just fly through our minds like a flash and are gone without real implementation. What brings the difference? Is there a methodology of doing things the right way? Like learning how to hold your cup right, by the handle? Doing product development and management the right way?

Software products have a life cycle. The life cycle has several stages that when followed accurately would result in a product that would be deployed successfully in a real world that's full of unpredicted challenges and factors. The standard software life cycle stages include:

- Scoping
- Conceptualization
- Market Research
- Poduct Discovery
- Implementation
- Testing
- Product launch
- Maintenance

Yes, you are not alone in thinking that implementation stage is the most important stage. At some point in life, everyone thinks that it's all about implementation. 

In this post you get to understand how each and every stage is important, why it's needed and how doing things the right way which entails following the above stages to the latter will lead to an outstanding product. 

We are currently working on a product, the right way and here's a recap of the planning phase and briefly how we experienced it. 

## Scoping Session

This was a session that involved a description of what the project was all about. An introduction to the idea and most importantly the plan. It involved an engagement between our client and us with the sole reason of 'investigating' the client's idea. The client introduced the idea, walked us through it, explaining the end goal and what value it would to bring to humanity. We would then discuss with the client and scribble notes for future reference.

There are a couple of methodologies of carrying out a project scoping exercise. Choosing the best methodology would really depend on your company culture and the nature of the project at hand. Without much consideration into the project scoping methodology to select, the end result of the scoping session should be a document that gives assurance of the full understanding of the project. This document is called a Concept Note.

## Conceptualization
It turned out that there is more to understanding the product than scribbling of notes. This stage involved coming up with a concept note.

A concept note is a literal capture of a client's idea, the problem that needs to be solved, description of the solution and outstanding features that are impeccable when compared to existing solutions. It's a document that lays out the description of the idea/product in a less tech-savvy way. 

> If you can't explain it in simple terms you don't understand it well enough.
~ Albert Einstein.

The standard way of writing the concept note is as follows:
#### Introduction
 	- This is the section where your reader is introduced to what is to follow ahead
#### Background
 	- Here, some history on the trends of the relevant market, what has been done before and how things are being done currently.
#### Problem Statement
 	- The challenges and the pains of the existing ecosystem.
#### Solution
 	- The proposed solution to address the above stated pains and challenges
#### Risks
 	- These are the unexpected things/events that may happen during the product development and could affect the product.
#### Mitigation
 	- These are the proposed solutions on how to control the unexpected events. The how of addressing the risks if they come to pass.
#### Conclusion
 	- Yea, you guessed it right!

### Re-scoping

Now after drawing up a concept note, It came to light that we had it all wrong.

We had another scoping session where the project was put into perspective, again.   It involved deeper but simpler explanations, positive criticism, many questions, note taking and much more. The second round was the real charm that led to a more accurate Concept Note.

In conclusion, the scoping session seeks to answer the following questions:

1. Who are the target users?
2. What problems are the target users experiencing? Past, current and 'future' problems if you can predict.
3. Is there any available solution. Is it helping out with the problems?
4. What are some of the risks that could affect the project/product?
5. What are the mitigation processes?

If you answer the above accurately, the subsequent stages in project management would be easy.

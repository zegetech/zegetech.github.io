intro: We always have ideas each and every day. Some are conceptualised and are actualized at some point in our lives but others just fly through our minds like a flash and are gone without real implementation. Others, manage to get into the execution ship but later on everything comes to a stand still and eventually stalls. What could lead to this? Is it missing a proper planning phase? A great project begins with great planning!

## Project Scoping

{{page.intro}}

A scoping session is an engagement between a client and a team of experts that seeks to "investigate" a clients idea. It's when the client introduces an idea in his mind to the experts, walks them through the idea, explains the end goal and what value it intends to bring to humanity, it's all about serving humanity, right? It helps the experts to be on the same page with the client. 

There are so many methodologies of carrying out a project scoping exercise. Choosing the best methodology would really depend on your company culture and the nature of the project at hand. Without much consideration into the project scoping methodology to select, the end result of the scoping session should be a document that gives assurance of the full understanding of the project. This document is called a Concept Note.

A concept note is a literal capture of a client's idea, the problem that needs to be solved, description of the solution and outstanding features that are impeccable when compared to existing solutions. It's a document that lays out the description of the idea/product in a less tech-savvy way. However, it involves a little bit of deep analysis of the whole idea.

The standard way of writing the concept note is as follows:
#### Introduction
 	- This is the section where your reader is introduced to what is to follow ahead
#### Background
 	- Here, some history on the trends of the relevant market, what has been done before and how things are being done currently.
#### Problem Statement
 	- The challenges and the pains of the existing ecosystem.
#### Solution
 	- The proposed solution to address the above stated pains and challenges
#### Risks
 	- These are the unexpected things/events that may happen during the product development and could affect the product.
#### Mitigation
 	- These are the proposed solutions on how to control the unexpected events. The how of addressing the risks if they come to pass.
#### Conclusion
 	- Yea, you guessed it right!


### Re-scoping

Now after drawing up a concept note. It may come to light that you had it all wrong.

You can have another scoping session where the project is put into perspective, again.   It may involve a round table meeting having each and every project team member explaining out their understanding of the project, getting logically positive criticism, asking many questions, answering many questions...just anything that could help the project team understand the idea accurately. The second round could be annoying but it could also be the charm leading to a more accurate Concept Note.

In conclusion, the scoping session seeks to answer the following questions:

1. Who are the target users?
2. What problems are the target users experiencing? Past, current and 'future' problems if you can predict.
3. Is there any available solution. Is it helping out with the problems?
4. What are some of the risks that could affect the project/product?
5. What are the mitigation processes?

If you answer the above accurately, the subsequent stages in project management would be easy.

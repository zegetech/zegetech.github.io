intro: The need for collaboration is inevitable and its value is evidenced by the existance of numerous amaizing products developed by teams that successfully and objectively worked together towards a specific goal. Collaboration tools have  evolved over the years making the collaboration easier and almost seamless. These tools have now made it possible to not only work as a team, but do it from anywhere at anytime. We at **Zegetech** have our very own selection, of tools, for the different phases of our development process.

## Project Management

We employ various project management tools to ensure that everyone is in sync. We all know what has been done, what needs to be done and who's doing whatever is currently being done. Currently our favorite tools happens to be [asana](https://asana.com/uses/project-management).

[More options here](2019-01-25-agile-product-development.md)

## Design

1. [Google suite](https://gsuite.google.com/).
   Google suite plays a huge role in collaboration for our design phase. Offering tools such as google docs for document sharing, interactive editing, commenting, presentations etc, Emails,hangouts, [draw.io](https://about.draw.io/) for those diagrams and charts. 
2. [Swagger hub](https://swagger.io/tools/swaggerhub/api-collaboration/)
   We use swagger to collaboratively design apis.

## Code sharing

Most developers I know enjoy working alone, mainly because of the hassle that comes with sharing code.  
Normally, for most devs, the process would be to either ..

1. Carry machine to person to share code with(May the forces be with you if yours weighs a ton and they are stationed in a different galaxy).
2. Pray they are not keyboard punchers(Yeah because keyboards have feelings too and deserve gentle).
3. Get help or move to the next galaxy for help from someone else.
4. Finally move back to own dimension

**or...**

1. Have the kind helping developer download/acquire the code somehow.
2. Set up their environments to run the code.
3. Notice that colon you missed.
4. Ping/text/email/call/whisper the mistake to you.
5. Clean up their machine because well they think your code is too young.

**or...**

1. Simply share screen, which is a good idea if you know who's right is the right right.

So how do we do it?

Online interactive code sharing tools;

1. [Codepile](https://www.codepile.net/home)
   CodePile is a real-time, cooperative code sharing hub. It provides more than the simple copy paste interface. Codepile allows interactive code sharing for most programming languages and you can take snapshots for different states of the shared code.

2. [repl.it](https://repl.it/)
   A step-up from codepile. Repl.it provides a development environment where you can run code and download packages, chat in workspaces and a shared compute engine.

Editor based code sharing tools.

1. Atom
   - [Teletype](https://teletype.atom.io/)
2. Brackets
   - [Multihack](https://github.com/multihack/multihack-brackets)  
3. SublimeText
   - [Remote​Collab](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/RemoteCollab)
4. Visual Studio
   - [Liveshare](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2017/11/15/live-share)

## Codestyle

We are also keen on style. Like most wonderful stories code is read more than it is written. We therefore make sure that the code we share is readable. How?

### Linting

1. [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)

### Editor syncing

1. [Editor Config](https://editorconfig.org/)

**Yes, we choose established practices over better subjective alternatives.**

## Version Control

No collaboration environment is complete without version control, we are no exception.

1. [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
We use a range of git based code hosting platforms;
   - [Github](https://github.com/)
   - [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/)
   - [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/)

## Testing

Finally the testing. We collaboratevely write tests and have them automated for CI/CD. Examples of tools we use include;

- [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/)
- [Circleci](https://circleci.com/)
  
And a personal fave for the APIs

- [Postman team](https://learning.getpostman.com/docs/postman/team_library/setting_up_team_library/).

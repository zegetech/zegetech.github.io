intro: I am learning how to do things the right way, learning how to hold my cup right,by the handle. Product development the right way. Software products have a life cycle. The life cycle has several stages.The most important stage is the planning stage.Yes, yes I know I also thought it was the implementation. I am currently working on a product, the right way. Here's a recap of the planning phase and how I experienced it.

### I. Scoping session

This was a session that involved a description of what the project is all about. An introduction to the Idea and most importantly the plan.

### II. Conceptualization
Turns out there is more to understanding the product than scribbling a couple of notes on a piece of paper while the client explains their idea, and stashing the paper somewhere safe for future reference, never to be seen again. 
This stage involved coming up with a concept note. A documented description of the project.

The document contained details on:
1. Background.
    A brief description of the product, the current market situation, and history of the industry.
2. The problem the product intends to solve.
    A description of the gap the product intends to fill. 
3. The available solutions if any.
    The available products, if any, that have been put in place to try a fix the problem and how they have failed.
4. The benefits of the product to the various stakeholders.
    The benefits the product hopes to bring to the various stakeholders.
5. The risks and mitigation strategies.



Easy, right?
Well, these are the first two standard steps. Before proceeding to the third, here are a two more "stages" that marked my first. These stages are not technically part of the normal product development lifecycle.

### Re-scoping
Now after drawing up a concept note. It came to light that I had it all wrong.

We had another scoping session where the project was put into perspective, again.<br/>
The second round could also be the charm. After explaining my understanding of the project. We got into a session where the team positively criticized my logic and answered a few questions.






### Re-conceptualization.
You guessed it I redid the conceptualization process and behold after sharing it?I was back on track.

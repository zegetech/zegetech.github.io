intro: Among the many tasks involved in software design phase there is user journey/user flow design. This is the design that tends to answer how your product's user will achieve the core goal of using your product. In this piece, we will get to understand what this means, why it's important to do a user journey/flow design, how it's done and sampling of the best user flow design tools highly recommended by [UX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience_design) designers.

Product design is the second phase in the product development lifecyle. It comes right before the development phase to ensure an efficient and fast development phase of the product. It also helps in catching bugs that would not have been caught during development. People, mostly developers find this phase boring and in most cases would be tempted not to do it but they will surely come to appreciate it when transfering their mental design solution to code. In most cases, this kind of approach will result in much product changes during the development phase which will actually slow down the whole product development process. It is therefore highly recommended that product stakeholders ensure a detailed design phase session. Get the mental solution to paper or digital design resource and use it in the development phase. You'll see how amazingly fast it will be.

## What are user flow/user journey designs?
These are the visual representation of the persona manourvering through a product solution in a clear logical path to goal accomplishment. User flow outlines the entry points, processes, decision making, loops, outputs and exit points of a product solution while the user journey focuses on the user's experience with the product. However, there's a thin line betweenn the two.

They are also used to provide a high-level communication to product stakeholders on how the user really makes his way through the product solution, hence acting as a bridge between developers and product stakeholders/clients. A user flow is similar to the flows that are hand-drawn on whiteboards during meetings with product stakeholders during brainstorming sessions. So, relax and hold your breathe, you already know it. 

Here are some insights on what makes the user flows/user journey:

#### Entry Points
What's the first thing an end user does when they discovering a product? Well, this is your persona's entry point. This is the point that invites the end user to the products functionality. You want to keep your end user? Focus should be here. Pay attention to the look and feel of your entry point, focus on things like the speed of loading up the product, color schemes, arrangement of your product components - like always placing login on top of your landing page or make it more visible if it's somewhere else, you don't want to get your user frustrated on the very first stop at your product...so much factors to be considered here. The trick is to think like a marketer focusing on window shoppers. 

#### Processes
This is now the real juice of your product. They represent the actual actions that an end user performs with hopes of attaining the final goal, for example the actions that would lead your user in making a payment on an online shop. Keep them clear, logical and engaging. Make them appear as if there's a virtual user talking to your end user. Focus on the end users experiences, feelings and perceptions relative to their needs and goals while going through the processes. 

You can optionally provide chronological guides that would help your end user in browsing through the product easily. 

#### Decision making and loops
These are the cyclic engagements of the user while taking actions on the product. They represent the various options available to a user in taking certain actions. They can be really useful in cases where a user is caught up in seemingly un-ending decision making. This can illuminate the product designers decision to escalate the user's frustration into 'critical level' and assign the user to user support personnel for a more direct and personal help.

#### Outputs
These are the messages the user get after taking a certain action. They include either success messages or error messages. In either case, the output should be clear and informative to avoid user confusion of what's going on.

#### Exit Point
They represent the final point of your users journey. At this point, always ensure that the user's goal has been accomplished. This will really determine whether the user makes a revisit to the product or not. 

Always keep in mind that a users journey continues even after accomplishing a task and exiting the product. The tendency is that a user would recommend the product to others or not. 

## How is it done?
With the advent of technology and simple look up on the internet, you'll come across various design tools used. From my UX design experience and research on top design tools used by UX designers, [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/), [Lucid chart](lucidchart.com), [creately](https://creately.com), [InVision](https://www.invisionapp.com) and [Marvel](https://marvelapp.com) top the list of the best [UX design tools](http://uxtools.co/tools). However, don't jump right into the online tools. First, make a research on the users needs, perceptions and pain points in accomplishing a goal. You can also map out your competitor's user journey during your research if it proves to be more revealing about the users needs, perception and pain points. Look into what keeps users sticked to a competitors product, observe the mechanisms used by competitors in achieving great user experience and much more. Doing the research will really help you in understanding the user well, what a user does inorder to accomplish a goal, a user's happy moments and much things about the user which will eventually lead to mapping out the user flow perfectly. The more you understand the journey, the higher the chances of designing a perfect user journey.

Then, have sketchy designs drawn on a piece of paper then transfer them onto your favorite digital design tool. Having the sketchy designs on a piece of paper or on sticky notes makes it easy to change the designs before transfering the final designs to an online design tool.

To make the process simple, I have it broken down to these four sub-processes:
- **Define your persona goal**. This answers the question `what do you want to do?` For example, `To Send money to My Contacts`, if you are building a digital money transfer app.

- **Define the task/process flows.** When definining the process flow, always keep in mind the scope of your goal to ensure that the users go through less steps in meeting their goals. You can use creately.

- **Define the wireflows and mockups.** This will help in valiating the user journey. To determine whether it needs improvement or not.

*Tool used - Creately*

- **Refine the wireflows and mockups into clickable mockups that depict a user journey**

## My advice on creating a good a user journey/user flow...
- keep it simple
- see it through your user's eyes
- keep it goal specific
- ensure it has all the important details needed
- ensure you use conventional diagrams in creating the designs

...because the point is to always provide the shortest and simplest steps that will help your end user move from point A to Z.

intro: | 
  We recently ran [a survey] within the developer community in Kenya, with the aim of understanding the state of the payment integrations ecosystem.
  We promised to release the results back to the community to hopefully move us all a step forward.
  If you find a place where we might have let our biases slip through, please be sure to call us out.

# Our respondents
![developer types](/assets/images/blog/integrations-survey/developer_types.png)

Nothing out of the expected here, would have been surprised if more of our respondents were front-end developers.
It is at least a little interesting that most of the developers identified as fullstack developers.

Looks like everyone dabbles in the dark arts, regardless of their job title.

Willing to back their knowledge in APIs.

![api integrations](/assets/images/blog/integrations-survey/integrated_with.png)

With an estimated 143 total API integrations. However, the integration process isn't always straight forward.
Only 7 of the respondents called the process 'easy' with a majority having at least a complaint or two.

# The Integrations
Particular to the APIs integrated with, we asked developers what they loved most about the APIs.
While for a significant portion(28%) nothing set their hearts a flutter, the rest did have something nice to say.

## Which questions do I want answers to?
Which are the top 3 most used apis
How easy was it to integrate each of the 3 most used pgws
- daraja/g2
- pesapal
- africa's talking

> daraja and g2 are 1?

Where a developer has indicated Mpesa APIs, how easy did they find the integration process?

Outliers: record#60 and #46 'other' response for what they loved about api

What percent of respondents reported that 'Nothing stood out'

Where used the payment gateways accounts:
  - how was the integration process
  - what influenced the choice

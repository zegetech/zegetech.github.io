Application programming Interface is made up of three computer terms; Application, Programming and Interface. Let's look at the definition of each.

Application - Any material or program that is designed for end-user(a person who ultimetely uses or is intended to use the product)to use.

Programming - The process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task.

Interface - A shared boundary across which two or more seperate components of a computer exchange information.

The nice guys from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) define and API as a set of subroutine definitions, communication protocols and tools for building a software.

From the above definations we can derive a simpler definition which we'll work with.

A system made up of sets of instructions that perform specific tasks as packaged units whose point of interaction allows exchange of information between the said system and other systems.The system contains a set of rules that govern this interaction(protocols).

The other systems could be a web-based system, an operating system, a database system, a computer hardware or a software library.
The APIs contain building blocks that can be put together by a developer to build a computer program.

API DESIGNS.

API design refers to exposure. How the API is made available to it's end users. There are four primary architectural design styles.Though not mutually exclusive these designs have a number of differences that are important to  note.

1. Uniform Resource Identifier Design.
This style allows developers to invoke requests through common Http operations. Many of the most basic operations a developer could want are mapped to the HTTP methods and functionalities — create, read, delete, and update invocations are all tied to built-in HTTP protocol functions. An example of it's usage is the REST API rchitecture. This design allows one-way interaction centered around a Resource.
2. Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) Design.
What stands out in the Event-Driven Architecture is that it's two-way street. Whereas other systems rely on either the client or the server listening and responding to events, the Event-Driven design requires both client and server to listen to new events.One of the most popular examples of the Event-Driven style is Java Swing. 
3. Hypermedia Architecture (HA) Design.
The Hypermedia Architecture is a middle ground approach between the Event-Driven Architecture and the URI Design — whereas the URI design focuses largely on objects and the requests for them, the Hypermedia Architecture focuses on tasks and the flow between them
4. Tunneling Style.
The Tunneling Style is the oldest of these four styles. It functions as a system of Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) organized in an XML message format.The most common way of utilizing this format is the SOAP architecture


Data formats
This is basically how the API handles interaction between data generation and data requests.There are a number of data formats available and popular in the API world.
JSON.
Example Data.
```json 
{"widget": {
    "debug": "on",
    "window": {
        "title": "Sample Konfabulator Widget",
        "name": "main_window",
        "width": 500,
        "height": 500
    },
    "image": { 
        "src": "Images/Sun.png",
        "name": "sun1",
        "hOffset": 250,
        "vOffset": 250,
        "alignment": "center"
    },
    "text": {
        "data": "Click Here",
        "size": 36,
        "style": "bold",
        "name": "text1",
        "hOffset": 250,
        "vOffset": 100,
        "alignment": "center",
        "onMouseUp": "sun1.opacity = (sun1.opacity / 100) * 90;"
    }
}}    

```
XML.
```xml
    <widget>
    <debug>on</debug>
    <window title="Sample Konfabulator Widget">
        <name>main_window</name>
        <width>500</width>
        <height>500</height>
    </window>
    <image src="Images/Sun.png" name="sun1">
        <hOffset>250</hOffset>
        <vOffset>250</vOffset>
        <alignment>center</alignment>
    </image>
    <text data="Click Here" size="36" style="bold">
        <name>text1</name>
        <hOffset>250</hOffset>
        <vOffset>100</vOffset>
        <alignment>center</alignment>
        <onMouseUp>
            sun1.opacity = (sun1.opacity / 100) * 90;
        </onMouseUp>
    </text>
</widget>
```
API documentation is a manual on how to use the API. An API documentation is meant for developers who want to take advantage of the tasks the system can perform.
There are many tools for auto generating and maintaining APIs. The generated documentation can either be static or interactive. Here's a table of a few common ones and sample documentation for each.

| Documentation tool | Demo                                        |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------|
| swagger            |[Swagger Demo](http://petstore.swagger.io/) |
| ------------------ |--------------------------------------------|
| ReDoc              | [ReDoc Demo](https://rebilly.github.io/RebillyAPI/#)|

API specification, often used interchangeably with API definition. It is a structured description of how the API behaves and what to expect from the it in ahuman readable format. It provides and indication of how the API is designed and the data types the API supports, without providing access to the source code.
An API specification can be used to generate a documentation.


API defination, similar to an API specification only meant for machines. A structured description of how the API functions. It can be used to generate documentation, SDKs and code samples. For use by automated tools.


Here's an example.

```
Praxis::ApiDefinition.define

    info do
        name 'Some App'
        title 'An example Praxis application'
        description 'A simple application meant for testing purposes'
        base_path '/'
    end

    info '1.0' do
        base_path '/v1'
    end

    response_template :other_response do
        status 200
    end

    trait :authenticated do
        headers do
        key "Auth-Token", String, required: true
        end

    end
end
```

intro: APIs are becoming the mainstream way of exposing services to the world and we all know that using a well-designed API is extremely rewarding, while using a poorly-designed API can be very infuriating. However, when we ourselves strive to build the best-designed APIs possible, we tend to trip up a bit. What aspects of an API should be considered in order to come up with a well designed API?What are the tools available tools to facilitate the API development process? Wait what is an API?

Application Programming Interface is made up of three computer terms; Application, Programming, and Interface. Let's look at the definition of each.

**Application** - Any material or program that is designed for an end-user(a person who ultimately uses or is intended to use the product).

**Programming** - The process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task.

**Interface** - A shared boundary across which two or more separate components of a computer exchange information.

With that, an API can be defined as a set of subroutine definitions, communication protocols and tools for building a software.


The API could be for a web-based system, an operating system, a database system, a computer hardware or a software library.
The APIs contain building blocks that can be put together by a developer to build a computer program.

### API DESIGNS.

API design refers to the API's pattern. How the API is made available to its end users. There are four primary architectural design styles. Though not mutually exclusive these designs have a number of differences that are important to note.

**1. Uniform Resource Identifier Design.**
This style allows developers to invoke requests through common Http operations. Many of the most basic operations a developer could want are mapped to the HTTP methods and functionalities — create, read, delete, and update invocations are all tied to built-in HTTP protocol functions POST, GET, DELETE and PUT respectively. An example of its usage is the REST API architecture. This design allows one-way interaction centered around a Resource commonly referred to as an object.

**2. Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) Design.**
As the name suggests, this pattern is centered around events. The events are defined at technical and business level.
Those events get triggered by specific actions or API calls
What stands out in the Event-Driven Architecture is that its two-way street. Whereas other systems rely on either the client or the server listening and responding to events, the Event-Driven design requires both client and server to listen to new events. One of the most popular examples of the Event-Driven style is [Java Swing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_architecture#Event_structure#Java_Swing). 

**3. Hypermedia Architecture (HA) Design.**
The Hypermedia Architecture is a middle ground approach between the Event-Driven Architecture and the URI Design — whereas the URI design focuses largely on objects and the requests for them, the Hypermedia Architecture focuses on tasks and the flow between them. A message-oriented design. With hypermedia APIs, the messages passed between components contain more than just data. They also include descriptions of possible actions. This means that actions, as well as data, are loosely coupled. A good example of an API offered as a service that implements this design is [Amazon API Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/api-reference/).

**4. Tunneling Style.**
The Tunneling Style is the oldest of these four styles. It functions as a system of Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs). It can be organized in an XML message format XML-RPC and JSON-RPC and most recent gRPC. The most common way of utilizing this format is SOAP architecture. The tunneling design is operation centered. This design exposes operations to manipulate data through HTTP as a transport protocol. tunneling APIs allow for localization of content, where RPC calls are used by distant hosts to request access as if the server providing the data is local.


### API DATA FORMATS
This is basically how the API handles interaction between data generation and data requests. There are a number of data formats available and popular in the API world. The following are the most common.

#### [JSON(Javascript Object Notation)](https://www.json.org/).
JSON is built on the popular Javascript programming language.
Both machine and human readable language built on two structures;
    1. A collection of name/value pairs.
    2. An ordered list of values.

Example 
```json 
{
 "title": "Json example",
 "properties": {
 "firstName": {
 "type": "string"
 }},
 "knownValue": {
 "type": "boolean"
 },
 "age": {
 "description": "Age in years",
 "type": "integer",
 "minimum": 18
 },
 "required": ["firstName", "lastName"]
}  

```
#### [XML(Extensible Markup Language)](https://www.w3.org/XML/).

A text format derived from [SGML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Generalized_Markup_Language).Like json XML is both human and machine readable.

```xml
<xs:element name="user" type="lettertype"></xs:element>
<xs:complextype name="lettertype" mixed="true">
  <xs:sequence>
    <xs:element name="usertype" type="xs:string"></xs:element>
    <xs:element name="userage" type="xs:positiveInteger"></xs:element>
    <xs:element name="regdate" type="xs:date"></xs:element>
  </xs:sequence>
</xs:complextype>
```
### API DOCUMENTATION 
API documentation is a manual on how to use the API. An API documentation is meant for developers who want to take advantage of the system's functions or services .
There are many tools for auto-generating and maintaining API documentation. The generated documentation can either be static or interactive. Here's a table of a few common ones and sample documentation for each.

| Documentation tool     | Demo                                         |
|  ---                   |  ------                                      |
| swagger                |[Swagger Demo](http://petstore.swagger.io/)   |

### API SPECIFICATION
API specification often used interchangeably with API definition. It is a structured description of how the API behaves and what to expect from it in a human-readable format. It provides an indication of how the API is designed and the data types the API supports, without providing access to the source code.
An API specification can be used to generate a documentation.


### API DEFINITION
API definition, similar to an API specification only meant for machines. A structured description of how the API functions. It can be used to generate documentation, SDKs and code samples. For use by automated tools.


Here's an example.

```
Praxis::ApiDefinition.define

    info do
        name 'Some App'
        title 'An example Praxis application'
        description 'A simple application meant for testing purposes'
        base_path '/'
    end

    info '1.0' do
        base_path '/v1'
    end

    response_template :other_response do
        status 200
    end

    trait: authenticated do
        headers do
        key "Auth-Token", String, required: true
        end

    end
end
```

### API TESTING.
 API testing as [defined by wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API_testing)is a type of software testing that involves testing application programming interfaces (APIs) directly and as part of integration testing to determine if they meet expectations for functionality, reliability, performance, and security.

Here's a list of some common API testing tools.
1. [SoapUI](https://www.soapui.org/)
2. [Katalon Studio](https://www.katalon.com/)
3. [postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)
4. [Tricentis Tosca](https://www.tricentis.com/software-testing-tools/)
5. [Apigee](https://cloud.google.com/apigee-api-management/)
6. [JMeter](https://jmeter.apache.org/)
7. [Rest-assured](http://rest-assured.io/)

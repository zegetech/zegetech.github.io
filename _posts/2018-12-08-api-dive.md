intro: APIs are becoming the mainstream way of exposing services to the world and we all know that using a well-designed API is extremely rewarding, while using a poorly-designed API can be very infuriating. However, when we ourselves strive to build the best-designed APIs possible, we tend to trip up a bit. What aspects of an API should be considered in order to come up with a well designed API? What are the available tools to facilitate the API development process? Wait what is an API?

{{page.intro}}

In order to build an API we need to understand what it is. API, Application Programming Interface is made up of three computer terms; Application, Programming, and Interface. Let's look at the definition of each.

**Application** - Any material or program that is designed for an end-user(a person who ultimately uses or is intended to use the product).

**Programming** - The process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task.

**Interface** - A shared boundary across which two or more separate components of a computer exchange information.

With that, an API can be defined as a set of subroutine definitions, communication protocols, and tools for building software. The API could be for a web-based system, an operating system, a database system, computer hardware or a software library. The APIs contain building blocks that can be put together by a developer to build a computer program.

The effectiveness of an API is determined by it's usability.

If developers can easily use the API then the API can graciously claim to have achieved its purpose. 
An API is usable if it accepts straight forward inputs, gives valuable feedback and is predictable. A predictable API is an API who's users know what to expect. Usability is achieved by implementing the appropriate API design, approriate and considtent data formats, proper documentation, specification and/or definition.

### API DESIGNS.

API design refers to the API's pattern or architecture, how the API is made available to its end users. Having a consistent API design and format is important as it facilitates better API maintenance and implementation. It also enables consumers(developers) to easily use the API as it reduces the learning and implementation curves.  There are four primary architectural design styles. Though not mutually exclusive, these designs have a number of differences that are important to note.

**1. Uniform Resource Identifier Design.**
This style allows developers to invoke reques*/ts through common HTTP operations. Many of the most basic operations a developer could want are mapped to the HTTP methods and functionalities — create, read, delete, and update invocations are all tied to built-in HTTP protocol functions POST, GET, DELETE and PUT respectively. An example of its usage is the REST API architecture. This design allows one-way interaction centered around a Resource commonly referred to as an object. It works best where data can easily be described as objects that can be manipulated within the CRUD cycle.

**2. Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) Design.**
As the name suggests, this pattern is centered around events. The events are defined at technical and business level.
Those events get triggered by specific actions or API calls
What stands out in the Event-Driven Architecture is that it's a two-way street. Whereas other systems rely on either the client or the server listening and responding to events, the Event-Driven design requires both client and server to listen to new events. One of the most popular examples of the Event-Driven style is [Java Swing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_architecture#Event_structure#Java_Swing). 

**3. Hypermedia Architecture (HA) Design.**
The Hypermedia Architecture is a middle ground approach between the Event-Driven Architecture and the URI Design — whereas the URI design focuses largely on objects and the requests for them, the Hypermedia Architecture focuses on tasks and the flow between them. A message-oriented design. With hypermedia APIs, the messages passed between components contain more than just data. They also include descriptions of possible actions. This means that actions, as well as data, are loosely coupled. A good example of an API offered as a service that implements this design is [Amazon API Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/api-reference/).

**4. Tunneling Style.**
The Tunneling Style is the oldest of these four styles. It functions as a system of Remote Procedure Calls [(RPCs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call). It can be organized in an XML message format transported over HTTP(XML-RPC), JSON message format transported over HTTP(JSON-RPC), or [gRPC](https://grpc.io/), which is a system that uses [HTTP/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2) for transport and [protocol buffers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_Buffers) for data serialization. Developed by Google, gRPC is an implementation of the Remote Procedure Call protocol built for efficiency and performance.gRPC is advertised for use in connecting services in a micro-services based architecture and connecting mobile devices and web clients to backend services.

The most common way of utilizing this format is [SOAP(Simple Object Access Protoco)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP) architecture. The tunneling design is operation centered. This design exposes operations to manipulate data through HTTP as a transport protocol. tunneling APIs allow for localization of content, where RPC calls are used by distant hosts to request access as if the server providing the data is local.

### Fun fact.
>  The 'g' in gRPC stand for different things with every gRPC release.
   - 1.0 'g' stands for 'gRPC'.
   - 1.1 'g' stands for 'good'.
   - 1.2 'g' stands for 'green'.
   - 1.3 'g' stands for 'gentle'
   - 1.4 'g' stands for 'gregarious'
   - 1.6 'g' stands for 'garcia'
   - 1.7 'g' stands for 'gambit'
   - 1.8 'g' stands for 'generous'
   - 1.9 'g' stands for 'glossy'
   - 1.10 'g' stands for 'glamorous'
   - 1.11 'g' stands for 'gorgeous'
   - 1.12 'g' stands for 'glorious'
   - 1.13 'g' stands for 'gloriosa'
   - 1.14 'g' stands for 'gladiolus'
   - 1.15 'g' stands for 'glider'
   - 1.16 'g' stands for 'gao'
   - 1.17 'g' stands for 'gizmo'


### API DATA FORMATS
This is basically how the API handles interaction between data generation and data requests. There are a number of data formats available and popular in the API world. The following are the most common.

#### [JSON(Javascript Object Notation)](https://www.json.org/).
JSON is built on the popular Javascript programming language.
Both machine and human readable language built on two structures;
    1. A collection of name/value pairs.
    2. An ordered list of values.

Example 
```Json 
{
 "title": "Json example",
 "properties": {"firstName": {"type": "string"}},
 "knownValue": {"type": "boolean"},
 "age": {"description": "Age in years","type": "integer","minimum": 18},
 "required": ["firstName", "lastName"]
}  

```
#### [XML(Extensible Markup Language)](https://www.w3.org/XML/).

A text format derived from [SGML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Generalized_Markup_Language).Like json XML is both human and machine readable. Compared to JSON, XML is a lot more verbose. When XML is written with opening/closing tag pairs, the message body can be significantly larger than the comparable json message. Data in XML format is passed as strings, requiring metadata to describe fields and corresponding data types.



Example
```xml
<xs:element name="user" type="lettertype"></xs:element>
<xs:complextype name="lettertype" mixed="true">
  <xs:sequence>
    <xs:element name="usertype" type="xs:string"></xs:element>
    <xs:element name="userage" type="xs:positiveInteger"></xs:element>
    <xs:element name="regdate" type="xs:date"></xs:element>
  </xs:sequence>
</xs:complextype>
```

So with the two, which one am I inclined to?
well Simba....

### API DOCUMENTATION 
The API documentation is a manual on how to use the API. It is meant for developers who want to take advantage of the api's functions or services.
There are many tools for auto-generating and maintaining API documentation. The generated documentation can either be static or interactive. Here's a table of a few common ones and sample documentation for each.

| Documentation tool     | Demo                                         | source

### API SPECIFICATION
API specification often used interchangeably with API definition. It is a structured description of how the API behaves and what to expect from it in a human-readable format. It provides an indication of how the API is designed and the data types the API supports, without providing access to the source code.
Now, this may make it sound like API  documentation and specification are the same things, they are not. The API documentation is essentially how to do something whereas a specification is how something should function.[Here's an example](https://swagger.io/specification/).
An API specification can be used to generate API documentation. The most common API specification formats are Swagger/ OpenAPI spec, RAML and API Blueprint.

#### RAML - RESTful Markup Language

[RAML](https://github.com/raml-org/raml-spec/blob/master/versions/raml-10/raml-10.md/) is an extension of the YAML specification for describing REST APIs
The yml syntax is easy to read and write and is easily parsed to generate documentation.
RAML is an end-to-end API tool providing for design, mocking, testing, documentation, and sharing.

#### OpenAPI

Previously Swagger, the [OpenAPI specification](https://swagger.io/specification/) is arguably the most widely adopted specification format.
The format is also based on YAML, making openapi specification documents easily readable.
Swagger also provides tooling for the API lifecycle.

#### API Blueprint

[API Blueprint](https://apiblueprint.org/documentation/specification.html) syntax is based on markdown, making it easily the most familiar for a developer.
Most of the tooling provided around API blueprint is developed by the community.

Formats for structuring JSON responses.

#### [JSON API](https://jsonapi.org/)
JSON API covers creating and updating resources as well, not just responses.

#### [JSend](http://labs.omniti.com/labs/jsend)
JSend focuses on application-level (as opposed to protocol- or transport-level) messaging which makes it ideal for use in REST-style applications and APIs.

#### [OData JSON Protocol](https://www.odata.org/documentation/odata-version-2-0/json-format/)
Data supports two formats for representing the resources (Collections, Entries, Links, etc) it exposes: the XML-based AtomPub format and the JSON format. 



### API DEFINITION
API definition, similar to an API specification. The only difference being API definition is meant for machine-consumption. It can be used to generate documentation, SDKs(Software Development Kits) and code samples. The languages used for API definition are similar to those used for [API specification][API SPECIFICATION]




### DIFFERENCE
The difference between API definition and API specification is a two-fold difference between human and machine readability, as well as purpose and goal. API Definition is far more concerned with the general definition of an API and its structure, whereas API specification is concerned with informing about the API and documenting the API itself.

This wouldn't be a dive, if we didn't mention API testing and mocking.

### API TESTING.
API testing as [defined by wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API_testing) is a type of software testing that involves testing application programming interfaces (APIs) directly and as part of integration testing to determine if they meet expectations for functionality, reliability, performance, and security.

Here's a list of some common API testing tools.
1. [SoapUI](https://www.soapui.org/)
2. [Katalon Studio](https://www.katalon.com/)
3. [postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)
4. [Tricentis Tosca](https://www.tricentis.com/software-testing-tools/)
5. [Apigee](https://cloud.google.com/apigee-api-management/)
6. [JMeter](https://jmeter.apache.org/)
7. [Rest-assured](http://rest-assured.io/)
8. [Assertible](https://assertible.com/)



### API MOCKING.
Mocking refers to the process of simulating behavior. API mocking can, therefore, be described as the process of simulating the behavior of an API. Instead of using an actual API, a "replacement" is created. The "replacement" behaves like the original API, but lacks many of the functional and non-functional characteristics of the original component Why mock an API? There are several scenarios whereas a developer one might need to mock an API. Take the example of the development stage of a system we'll call system Y. System Y might have external dependencies whose point of interaction is an API. The said system may not be available during development for security or other reasons. In such a case System Y's developer might need to create a mock of the said dependancy's API in order to proceed with the development process. For testing in cases where again the API is not available or for integration demonstration where exposing the actual API pose security risks. Most API tools named above such as SoapUI and Postman provide API mocking services along with other services to support the APIs lifecycle. There are, however, other tools both local and online that are dedicated to API mocking.

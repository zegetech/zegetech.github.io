intro: What comes into your mind when you come across the word agile? This is a very common word. Perhaps you wouldn't even blink your eyes before shouting out the answer. Agile software development has been around for over a decade as of this post, has improved over the years, driving people away from the traditional software development process. But what would you say if I tell you that we've moulded this amazing process into a whole new hybrid product development style? Yes, we have. I suppose you love growth and would love learning a new results-proven interesting product development process.

I want to introduce the new Agile Product Development lifecycle that we've been using over the years here at Zegetech. It's a process that has seen successful launch of low risk products. We've perfected on the process and we feel like it's time to let it known to the community. It's a world of Open Source, right?

This is a bird's-eye view of the 3-4 months process from idea to launch! Please note that the words product and project will be used interchangeably, no need for alarms.

Before diving into the phases of development, here is a tabular capture on the whole development process.

|Phase|Inputs|Outputs/Deliverables|Activity|Tasks|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Scoping|Idea|Estimate,concept note, sprint plan|Scoping meeting|Brainstorming, Ideation, Problem Definition|
|Discovery|Sprint Plan, Concept Note|Software Requirement Specification(SRS), Project Plan, Story Board|Discovery Sprint|Project Plan, Schedule, Budget Scope, Project estimates, problem definition, project resourcing, planning|
|Design|SRS| Blueprint, Solutions Design, Software Design Description(SDD), Behaviour Driven Development(BDD)|Designing, Scheduling, Resourcing|BMC, VPC, SRS, Product Prototype Brief, Solutions Design, Pitch Desk, Tool Setup,  Mockups, Models|
|Development|BDD,SDD|Prototype, Product Map|Development, staging, tests|Repo Setup, Staging Environment Setup, Planning, Coding, Tests, Code Review, Documentation|
|Pilot|Prototype|Minimum Viable Product(MVP), Support Contract, Version 2|Live test, Piloting, Bug fix|MVP, Production, Pilot Review, Discover Product Market Fit, Product roadmap, case study|

## I. Scoping
![Scoping](/assets/images/blog/agile/scoping.jpg){:class="img-responsive center"}<br>
This is the first stage in our product development lifecycle. This is when the client introduces the idea to the project team for brainstorming and problem definition with the intention of getting everyone on the same page, on what the product is all about. It entails assessment of the product, its features, goals, deliverables, tasks, deadlines, resource requirements, its relevance to the current market and the customer acceptance. It will involve a brainstorming session with each individual in the project team giving their own understanding of the product. At this point, there's no good or bad perspective. Everything is laid bare on the table for discussions. 

Before the 2-hour brainstorming session, the client is provided with Zegetech's tool called a Rise Guide that's specifically designed and thought out to help the client think through their idea. In the Rise Guide the client will get to answer the WHYs, Hows and WHATs of the idea. With client's response to the Rise Guide, an effective scoping session is assured.

Project team members are then be asked to do a deeper market analysis to clearly identify the need of the product at hand. It will encompass research on possible competitors in the market, customer preferences, customer challenges, possible outstanding features of the product that may make it impeccable compared to other poducts and so on. You can do a questionnaire too,

The findings at this point are then compiled into an easy to understand document called a Concept Note.

A concept note is a literal capture of a client's idea defined during the brainstorming session. Below is the standard format of the concept note.

1. Introduction<br>
 	- This is the section where your reader is introduced to the whole project idea. Basically, an overview of the idea. 
2. Background<br>
 	- Here, some history on the trends of the relevant market, what has been done before and how things are being done currently.
3. Problem Statement<br>
 	- The challenges and the pains of the existing ecosystem.
4. Solution<br>
 	- The proposed solution to address the above stated pains and challenges
5. Risks<br>
 	- These are the unexpected things/events that may happen during the product development and could affect the product.
6. Mitigation<br>
 	- These are the proposed solutions on how to control the unexpected events. The how of addressing the risks if they come to pass.
7. Conclusion<br>
 	- Yea, you guessed it right!

The concept note should be a simple and easy to understand document.

)

When the client fails to conform to the Concept note after the scoping session, a second brainstorming session is required. This will involve a re-evaluation of the idea. However, the decision here purely lies on the outcome of the first session.

The Expected output of this stage is a concept note, product estimates and a product discovery sprint plan.

## II. Product Discovery/Review
![Discovery](/assets/images/blog/agile/discovery.jpeg){:class="img-responsive center"}<br>
The project team then takes up the Scoping Session output and go on a 5-day product discovery sprint. The result of the discovery sprint is the project storyboard, Software Requirement Specification(SRS), project plan, project resourcing and project estimates.

This is the stage that allows the project team to dive into the future of the product. It's a phase that digs deeper into the concept note. It helps the team analyse the problems further, understand the goals of the project, ideation of the solutions, selection of the best solution, creation of mockups and prototypes and conducting the user tests of the prototypes created. 

A team of experts and possible product users is then assembled for interviews, surveys and prototype tests. 

The goal of this phase is to come up with and validating the best solution that will capitalize on the users' pain points.User pain points are great opportunities and the best selling points.

Expected output of this stage is the project plan, System Requirement Specification and the storyboard.

## III. Design
![Design](/assets/images/blog/agile/design.png){:class="img-responsive center"}<br>
This is the visualization stage of the project idea.

The team focuses on brainstorming over the project plan, the storyboard and the SRS gotten earlier on with special attention to the user. Also, this is the time when developers are invited, in case they are external, just to get their input. The designers walk the developers through the story board, conversing about software architecture, and blockers if any. The collaboration bit will make things easier during the next phase. It simplifies, the already 'complex' storyboard for the developer.

Visual and user experience aspects of the solution are put into perspective, rough sketches of models and mockups drawn by digital visualization tools whether online or offline or simply using pen and paper. The designs are then made visible to the project team and users by pinning them on the walls, whiteboards or digital devices like large TV screens. This allows everyone to ask questions, make comments and talk about constraints. After the thorough analysis of the sketches, the final bluebrint of the product is now developed.

This is all done without a single line of code. 

## IV. Development

<br>
Product development begins! 

The project team gets the solution design and prototypes from the design phase, sets the development environment ready and voila! Work begins!

With accuracy and clarity from the previous stages, this phase is actually the easiest. The stage involves great coordination amongst project team members, constant communication with end-users to keep the product in check against user needs and experience, timely testing, code reviews and product documentation. 

The goal is working towards version 1 of the product.

The trick here is to go through this phase as fast as possible because the world is always in constant change. You do now want to build a product that was modern  and in demand while you started working on it but outdated when you launch it! 

> *"Move fast and break things. Unless you are breaking stuff, you are not moving fast enough."* - Mark Zuckerberg at an interview with Business Insider

However, don't rush through it. Quality!

The most common challenges during this phase include:

 - poor management of resources(time, money)
 - lack of coordination
 - bureaucracy
 - poor organization
 - lack of motivation

## V. Product Pilot
![Pilot](/assets/images/blog/agile/pilot.png){:class="img-responsive center"}<br>
We now have a pre-launch product. However, it's still not suitable for public use.

The team now embarks on the first phase of testing the product. This is called Alpha Testing. The team can decide to test the product internally or have the pre-selected target users test the product. This will lead to further refining and fixing of bugs.

Beta testing follows afterwards. The now refined product is ready for the first public testing. The choice of the beta version target market will have a great influence on the success of the product in the market. A careful analysis needs to be done before hand. 

Beta version reports are then written, fixing of found bugs, market-fit analysis, product performance assessment and customer needs satisfaction evaluation. Once the product is out of glitch and things work perfectly.

The product is now ready for version 1.

### Launch or No Launch?

This wholly depends on the critical analysis of customer reactions, product performance and market acceptance.
